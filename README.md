This project consists of a full-stack application, with 3 clients (Console, WPF, Javascript). The theme of the application is the NBA, it stores the players, teams, and divisions, with some of their statistics like player's average points.
- The app implements the four basic functions (CRUD), and some extra functions to show complex statistics for each model.
